# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Post.create(title: "Hello1", description: "This is the description1")
# Post.create(title: "Hello2", description: "This is the description2")
# Post.create(title: "Hello3", description: "This is the description3")
# Post.create(title: "Hello4", description: "This is the description4")
# Post.create(title: "Hello5", description: "This is the description5")
